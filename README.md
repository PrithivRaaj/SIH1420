Abstract
As the field of artificial intelligence progresses, understanding and managing the computational complexity of large language models, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), becomes increasingly crucial. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks but often come with significant computational demands. Efficiently reasoning about and managing their computational complexity is essential for practical deployment and further advancements in AI research.This project introduces a lean module designed specifically for reasoning about computational complexity in GPTs. The module provides a systematic framework for assessing and predicting the computational resources required for different tasks and model configurations. Leveraging principles from algorithmic analysis and complexity theory, the module offers insights into the factors influencing computational complexity in GPTs, including model size, input length, and task complexity.
